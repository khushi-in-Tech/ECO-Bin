> **Transform e-waste into eco-rewards** – A gamified platform that makes electronic waste recycling easy, rewarding, and fun!

---

## 🎯 The Problem

**E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream globally**, yet only **17.4% gets recycled properly**. The main barriers are:

- ❌ **Lack of awareness** – People don't know how/where to recycle electronics
- ❌ **No incentives** – There's no motivation to recycle responsibly  
- ❌ **Inconvenience** – Finding recycling centers is difficult
- ❌ **Language barriers** – Many platforms are English-only

**In India alone**, we generate **3.2 million tonnes** of e-waste annually, but less than **10% is recycled formally**.
